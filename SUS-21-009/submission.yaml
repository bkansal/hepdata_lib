comment: A search for new physics in final states consisting of at least one photon,
  multiple jets, and large missing transverse momentum is presented, using proton-proton
  collision events at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data correspond to an
  integrated luminosity of 137$fb^{-1}$, recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN
  LHC from 2016 to 2018. The events with signal-like characteristics are divided into
  mutually exclusive bins characterized by the missing transverse momentum, the number
  of jets, the number of b-tagged jets, and jets consistent with the presence of hadronically
  decaying W, Z, or H bosons. The observed data are found to be consistent with the
  prediction from standard model processes. The results are interpreted in the context
  of pair production of supersymmetric particles via strong and electroweak interactions,
  assuming simplified models. Depending on the details of the signal models, gluinos
  and squarks of masses up to 2.35 and 1.43 TeV, respectively, and electroweakinos
  of masses up to 1.30 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.
